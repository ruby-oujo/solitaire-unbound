Take the regular rules of solitaire with a double twist!


Take the regular rules of solitaire with a double twist!
1. To operate the game enter a deck size and click “Load Deck”
2. Press the “Go position” button to initiate the deck.
3. Then type in two integer values; placement of the deck to move from and deck to
move to, and simply click “Go position” to execute!


How do you win?
FIRSTLY:
The original rules; take a deck of size n and sort them into a stack that is NOT stack is not 0 in descending order ie. 8 7 6 5 etc; cards can only be moves if their last element is one bigger than the first element of the cards that is moving. You can move a single card or a stack of cards this way. Moving the front of stack 0 to the back of stack 0 is always a valid move.


CHANGES:
When you enter a deck size, the game will produce two times of the deck! (Excluding the last biggest value which only has one). To win this game you must stack all, yes all the cards onto ONE pile! To make this easier for you, you can stack both ways; from 0 1 2 3 or 3 2 1 ; you can mix and match these two methods BUT they must be within 1 integer value of each other.
To win you must stack all cards onto one pile!
There are VERY limited solutions to get all the cards onto one pile!


TIP: Start out with a smaller deck to understand the problem There is a hidden prize at the end of the game!
GOOD LUCK! Happy Gaming!
